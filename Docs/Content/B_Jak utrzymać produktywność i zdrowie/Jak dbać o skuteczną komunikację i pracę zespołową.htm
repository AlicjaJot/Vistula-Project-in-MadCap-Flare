                                            <h2>Facing conflicts</h2>
                                            <p>Wherever two or more people meet, different viewpoints, opinions, aspirations, etc., also meet, and thus conflicts arise. Disagreements are natural, and they also happen among teams that work stationary. In a remote working environment this is sometimes more difficult, but not impossible. If you have a problem with effective communication, which manifests itself in unpleasant situations, among other things, <b>accept that conflicts are natural and can be resolved</b>. First of all, talk to your co-workers. In situations of discord, it is better to use video communicators or the telephone, as talking only through written messages can cause us to misinterpret a colleague's words or face misunderstanding of our messages ourselves.</p>

                                            <h3>Learning to communicate effectively</h3>
                                            <p>It is important to be able to openly communicate, to express one's feelings, concerns and motivations, but when necessary also to able to admit a mistake, apologize and accept compromise. The ability to communicate effectively is crucial not only among remote workers, but in home office mode it becomes all the more important. That's why many companies organize various trainings and workshops to teach employees the soft skills necessary for teamwork. Plenty of organizations also have similar training courses in internal e-learning databases for their employees. You can use such resources or notify your supervisor of your desire to attend a training course on effective communication. You can also find plenty of materials on the Internet.</p>
                                            <h2>Openness and transparent structure of the organization</h2>
                                            <p>To be part of a successful team, set an example with your own behaviour. Create a culture within the organization based on open and honest communication. Build trust by, among other things, sharing your knowledge, helping and involving colleagues in decision-making or brainstorming.</p>
                                            <p>Solicit regular meetings with the team. Communication is better when leaders communicate what is going on in the company, and when information about the allocation of colleagues' responsibilities and current projects is public.</p>
                                            <p>Many companies also maintain various organizational structure diagrams. Use such sources and you will find out who holds what position, reports to whom and what they do. This will make it easier for you to establish business contacts and effectively collaborate with other remote employees.</p>
                                            <h2>Showing a human face</h2>
                                            <p>As a home office employee, you are nothing more than an icon on a monitor to others in your company. To facilitate communication you can become more “human”. It's a good idea to include a <b>brief description of yourself</b> in the communicator your organization uses. It can even be a link that takes you to a document with several pieces of information entwined with images. Try to make this form of presentation as “virulent” as possible, so do not write a long dissertation about what kind of person you are, but limit yourself to a few useful facts about, for example, what kind of cooperation you like, what you are best at or what hours you are not to be bothered. Don't be afraid to also write here about what you like to do in your free time and show pictures with your family. A few facts about your private life will give some kind of an anchor to a person who needs to make contact with you for the first time.</p>
                                            <h2>The power of team-building meetings</h2>
                                            <p>If you're having trouble with communication and remote teamwork, also push for “live” employee integrations. Many companies organize them periodically. Even one meeting in the real world and a joint, integrative activity is enough to make the team more united and more cooperative later on. Various online meetings, but not directly related to the professional sphere, can also be helpful. For example, you can draw or play a game of puns together.</p>
                                            <h2>Principles of communication and use of software applications</h2>
                                            <p>For effective remote communication, it is also important to set rules for how you want to communicate with other employees. If you know that you're most productive between e.g. 11 AM and 3 PM, and the messages you're receiving or any call attempts with you at that time just annoy you, let everyone know that you'd rather they contact you during other hours. In your bio in remote communicators write whether you prefer email communication, phone or video calls. Do the same for your co-workers, ask them about their communication preferences too, and they will appreciate the respect you shown.</p>
                                            <p>Remote work is supported by various tools. Take advantage of their benefits. Various dashboards, shared documents or other programs that help link the work of several people, contribute to the effective cooperation of teams working from different parts of the earth.</p>
                                            <p>If your team consists of people living in different time zones, you must take this into account in any attempt to communicate. After all, you wouldn't want someone to call you in the middle of the night, would you? Every time, make sure you don't do the same. Set meeting times that are acceptable to all parties. Keep also in mind possible cultural differences and approach with tolerance and openness to other customs, such as greetings or farewells.</p>
                                            <h2>Proper conditions and tested equipment</h2>
                                            <p>There is no effective remote communication and collaboration when the tools fail. Home office mode depends on a stable Internet connection and reliable hardware and software. Therefore, before you call someone, make sure you are not disturbed by any noise or external factors and test your microphone and headphones. Discovering problems with video, audio, presentation sharing or other application functions and dealing with them once the connection is established, will be annoying for both you and the other party. Do not let your co-worker's valuable time be wasted that way.</p>
