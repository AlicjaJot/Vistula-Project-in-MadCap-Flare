                                            <h2>Mindful fight against distractions</h2>
                                            <p>One of the reasons for lower productivity in home office mode can sometimes be various distractions. These can be things related to your home space, such as the proximity of your favourite game console or TV with an addictive series, or notifications coming from various social media or annoying noises from outside of your window. When working remotely, it's definitely easier to browse Facebook for too long or extend a break to play the guitar. All because of the employee's lack of direct control in the form of a presence of other team members or a supervisor.</p>

                                            <p>The first step to fighting the temptation to give in to what distracts you from your work is self-awareness. Therefore, be vigilant, observe yourself, and in the beginning <b>even write down what distracts you</b>, what you succumb to most easily, and how much time it consumes. Once you know, for example, that you reach for your phone every time you hear a social media notification, fighting this unwanted habit will become much easier. You can simply turn off notifications for the duration of your work or leave your phone in another room.</p>
                                            <p>If you find it difficult to work because your game console is in your line of sight, think about physically separating yourself from such a distractor. Also, move it to another room or position your desk so that no distractor is nearby.</p>
                                            <p>If even that does not help and you are still closer to lying on the couch with a TV series for too long, consider working from a nearby coffee shop or coworking space. You can turn on the series there too, but it will be much more difficult - especially if you spend money to pay for such a place or buy coffee that is more expensive than that from your home coffee machine.</p>
                                            <h3>A way to deal with annoying noises</h3>
                                            <p>A coffee shop or open coworking space may not be a good idea if you cannot maintain productivity amidst various noises. However, this problem can also affect you at home. If an extended renovation at your neighbour’s house or work on the street down the block is something that knocks you out of your rhythm, it's worth getting good noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs or even investing in solutions like acoustic wallpaper. Since remote work is your modus operandi and you want it to stay with you for a long time, such an investment will pay off. You can always try to raise funds from your company's budget. I have had success with this. Many companies subsidize the home office of their employees.</p>
                                            <h2>Internal and external motivation</h2>
                                            <p>Each employee may need different factors to arouse their motivation to work and keep them working remotely. Only <b>you yourself know best what would bolster your desire for high performance</b>. Think about it.</p>
                                            <p>Sometimes it can be helpful to have a honest conversation with your supervisor. If you don't feel adequately appreciated, would like to take on an independent project, or think you should work more closely with your team, tell them. Ask for a meeting and talk about your concerns. You may be able to work out solutions together that will give you newfound supplies of fresh motivation.</p>
                                            <p>There are a few universal factors that tend to bolster work motivation. They do not necessarily work for everyone, but you can try them out to see if they will help you either. It's good to know <b>the purpose and intended effect of your actions</b>. Performing duties without knowing what real business, reputational, or other benefits they will bring to the company, what they will give to the customer, etc. can sometimes be demotivating. No one wants to do things without a sense of their purpose. The same goes for knowing the progress of a project. It's good to see that the work is moving forward. Many people are also motivated to work by <b>the possibility of growth</b> - the realization that with each new task they are learning something new and expanding their own competence.</p>
                                            <p>Many people feel well motivated to work as a team. If we are responsible for completing task A, without which it is impossible to complete task B, for which our teammate is already responsible for, it will come much easier to deal with our own obligations on time. What is more, working closely together, helping each other, exchanging ideas and putting solutions up for discussion drives creative action and increases motivation to work. The solution, therefore, may be to strengthen cooperation with your team.</p>
                                            <h2>Organization of work time and tasks</h2>
                                            <p>If you want to stay productive, plan your work time. Designate the hours you will work on a given day. Create your own routine for work and breaks and stick to that schedule. During this time, you can actually act as if you were in the office and not at home. Then your working hours will actually be different from your leisure hours, which, for example, you will no longer plan so meticulously and allow yourself for more slack.</p>
                                            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                                                <li>Plan your deadlines and the time needed to complete certain tasks as well. Set specific goals that you want to accomplish in a given day and week. Remember to make them realistic!</li>
                                                <li>Keep a to-do list and tick off each completed duty. This will give you the satisfaction of a completed duty and help you see your progress. This will also give you motivation to tackle the next task.</li>
                                                <li>Divide large, overwhelming projects into smaller tasks. The smaller the responsibilities involved, the easier it is to get on with them, and completing each one helps you tackle the next and see real progress.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <p>In implementing such an organization of your own work, you will be helped by a simple paper notebook or programs created just for this purpose. You can use free versions that will keep your schedule in check.</p>
                                            <p>Remember to always <b>focus exclusively on one task at a time</b> and only move on to the next task once it is completed. Don't get distracted by trying to perform several duties at the same time.</p>
                                            <h3>Pomodoro technique</h3>
                                            <p>You can also try the pomodoro technique or create your own variation of it. It's a routine that consists of 25-minute stretches of intense work, during which you focus solely on the task at hand and don't succumb to any distractions. Such productive stretches of time are punctuated by 5-minute breaks, signalled by an audible alarm, during which you try to take a total break from your work. Several “sessions” of work and breaks are followed by a longer pause of, say, 20 minutes. The pomodoro technique is a way to not succumb to distractions, to set yourself up for maximum productivity at work, and to give yourself time to rest effectively.</p>
                                            <h2>Effectively rest and rewarding yourself</h2>
                                            <p>Effective rest also plays a key role in maintaining productivity. No overworked employee can be truly productive. Therefore, be sure to take regular breaks and use them wisely. During your moments of respite, instead of checking what is out there on social media, give your eyes and body a rest. Get up from your desk and get out for some fresh air. You can also do some simple exercises to stretch your back, arm and leg muscles. Eat regular well-balanced meals (preferably every 3-4 hours). Avoid sugary snacks, which can make you feel sleepy, and drink plenty of water. Take your eyes off screens every hour, blink and look away for a few minutes.</p>
                                            <p>Rewarding yourself can also help you stay motivated and productive when working remotely. Whenever you complete an important task or achieve a goal, appreciate yourself. Recognize that you conquered a difficult task and allow yourself a small reward. For example, it could be a break in the form of a short walk, going out for a delicious cup of coffee or watching an episode of your favourite TV series.</p>
