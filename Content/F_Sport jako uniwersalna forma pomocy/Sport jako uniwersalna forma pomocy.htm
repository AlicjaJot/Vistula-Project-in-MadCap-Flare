        <h1>Sport as a universal form of help</h1>
        <h2>Everyone needs exercise</h2>
        <p>Sports and physical activity are universal forms of assistance that can improve the overall well-being of any remote worker, regardless of what exactly is the source of their problems. In home office mode one performs intellectual work. For the vast majority, this simply means working in a sitting position using a computer. Sitting in one position for 8 hours five days a week puts a lot of strain on our bodies. Human bodies are designed to move and remote workers, regardless of the problems they might feel, are in desperate need of physical activity. Sport, not just professional sports, has a healing effect on our psyche. Even patients in deep depression are advised to for example take daily walks as a form of supportive therapy.</p>

        <h2>Physical activity for you</h2>
        <p>Therefore, I encourage you to <b>find a form of physical activity that works for you</b>. You don't have to suddenly start running like a pro. On the contrary - don't do it, because you will only harm yourself. You can even start with short but regular walks. Look for a form of sport that makes you happy or is at least acceptable for you. If you are not sure what activity you can undertake without injuring yourself and which form of sport will be best for you, consult a personal trainer or physiotherapist.</p>
