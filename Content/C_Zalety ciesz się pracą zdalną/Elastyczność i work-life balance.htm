        <h1>Flexibility and work-life balance</h1>
        <p>A great advantage of remote work is that it introduces flexibility to the employees day schedule. Thanks to the home office you don not need to use up your vacation days just to take care of some official matters or attend a doctor's appointment scheduled in the middle of work hours. Remote work allows for arranging your day flexibly enough to accommodate both 8 hours of work with other activities. This helps maintain a healthy balance between private and professional life, i.e.: work-life balance. Due to this remote work is the most appreciated by people raising children, who reconcile professional career with other life responsibilities or that simply like working at non-standard hours.</p>

        <p>You can work for example starting from 8 AM to noon, then take a 2 hour long walk, go to the cinema or a restaurant, and then go back to your work duties. Do something that is pleasent for you and yet something that you could not do if you worked rigid hours in the office. Learn to benefit from the flexibility that the remote work gives you.</p>
