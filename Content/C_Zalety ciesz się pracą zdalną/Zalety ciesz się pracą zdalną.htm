        <h1>The advantages: enjoy working remotely!</h1>
        <p>Working remotely has many positives. I only list a few in this guide. I have chosen only those that I could relate to specific tasks for you. I'm sure that, when you carry them out, you'll be reminded anew of the good things about home office work and will be able to appreciate it more. It's great if you also feel the satisfaction of taking advantage of some of the possibilities offered by remote work.</p>

        <div class="accent">However, only go to this part of the guide and the tasks posted here after implementing the tips and ways to combat the dark side of the remote work from the “<a href="../B_Jak utrzymać produktywność i zdrowie/Jak utrzymać produktywność i zdrowie.htm">How to stay productive and healthy?</a>” section.</div>
        <p>If you try to force yourself to feel the joy of working remotely before you've learned how to deal with what's driving you down, you may alienate yourself for good from the content presented here or, what is worse, from any other source of self-help. After all, there's no point in telling a person who has just been dumped by a beloved partner that it's actually a good thing, because new social opportunities have just opened up for them. It's too early for them to see the advantages of such a situation.</p>
