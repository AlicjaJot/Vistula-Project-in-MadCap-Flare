        <h1 class="Print">No commuting</h1>
        <p>The most basic benefit of working remotely is no need to travel to your workplace. Often, working in an office means long, even over an hour long trip, being stuck in traffic or facing the unpleasantries of public transportation. Working from the comfort of your own home is a huge saver of time, energy and funds that would be otherwise be spent on fuel or tickets. This is one of the main advantages of the home office work mode.</p>

        <div class="accent">Exercise for you: Feel the satisfaction of not needing to travel to the office.</div>
        <p>Imagin that you work in a company located in the most crowded office building in your area. It might be a neighbouring city or the centre of your town. Check how much time it would take you to get there during the morning rush hours and at what hour would you need to get out of bed. Write down that hour. Estimate how much money would you spent monthly for such daily trips. Write down that price. Imagine as well that you would also need to prepare yourself a meal for the next day at work. Your remote work has some advantages, doesn’t it?</p>
