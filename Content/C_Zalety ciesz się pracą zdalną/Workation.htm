        <h1>Workation</h1>
        <p>A very attractive advantage of working remotely is the ability to work not only from your own home, but also from anywhere in the world. This is again an aspect that supports the so-called work-life balance. An employee doesn't have to take a vacation if they want, for example, to go visit their relatives for a week. They can work from their family home, and in their free time hang out with people dear to them.</p>

        <p>The same is true if we dream of combining work and vacation. The same is true if we dream of combining work and vacation. The so-called workation means going to some attractive tourist place in the country or abroad, but with good Internet access and working conditions, and enjoying its charms at leisure time.</p>
        <p>Working remotely not only allows for more mini-vacations per year than the stationary mode, but also enables one to practice the life of a digital nomad. This is a person who works remotely and travels regularly around the world, not actually having a single, permanent home. Digital nomads can even change the places where they sleep, work and explore the world on a weekly basis.</p>
        <div class="accent">Excercise for you: Go for a little workation!</div>
        <p>Find a place you'd like to visit. It doesn't have to be abroad, although, by all means, it can. However, remember to make sure you will have good Internet connection and a quiet place to work. Many Polish and foreign hotels, guesthouses or agritourism farms invite people to workation and create a friendly infrastructure for their guests to work.</p>
        <p>Plan the attractions and activities you will enjoy when you turn off the computer. Enjoy your workation!</p>
