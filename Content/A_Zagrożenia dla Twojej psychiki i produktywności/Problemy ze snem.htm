        <h1>Sleep problems</h1>
        <p>Remote work can contribute to insomnia or other sleep disorders. Various factors generate such problems. Here are the most common ones:</p>
        <h3>Inability to separate work and private life</h3>
        <p>When we work from home, the boundaries between work and leisure easily blur. This can lead to difficulties in “switching off” from work mode and make it difficult to relax and calm down before bed.</p>

        <h3>Work in the bedroom</h3>
        <p>The bedroom is a space dedicated solely to rest. If we work from bed or our desk stands in the bedroom, we may constantly feel stress, tension, readiness, and other emotions associated with the professional sphere. At bedtime, it will effectively prevent us from well rest.</p>
        <h3>Lack of physical activity</h3>
        <p>Sleep problems can also be caused by rarely leaving the house and not getting enough exercise.</p>
        <h3>Exposure to screens</h3>
        <p>Looking at computer, tablet, or phone screens for long periods, especially in the evening, can interfere with the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep.</p>
        <h3>Stress and anxiety</h3>
        <p>Remote work, like any professional activity, can generate stress and anxiety. If there are too many such emotions, and the employee is unable to cope with them properly, various sleep problems can arise.</p>
        <h3>Disturbed sleep rhythm</h3>
        <p>Remote workers who do not have fixed working hours and a regular daily routine, or who practice performing tasks in the evenings, may experience sleep problems.</p>
