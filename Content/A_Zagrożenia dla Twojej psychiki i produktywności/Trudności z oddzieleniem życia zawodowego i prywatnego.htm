        <h1>Difficulties with work-life balance</h1>
        <p>Working remotely usually means working from home - a space associated with private life. Home is where we relax and spend time with loved ones. The home office brings the professional sphere into a private, intimate space. This can make it difficult to maintain a work-life balance.</p>

        <p>Working remotely takes away the ability to shed the stress of leaving the office and going home - to physically leave professional matters in another space. Even if an employee finishes work and turns off the computer, his thoughts can still revolve around work matters, and the accompanying stress can impede effective rest. Constant thoughts about work matters and proximity to the computer promote the practice of working beyond the norm, which can turn into workaholism or prevent effective rest in our own home. Possible consequences include deteriorating relationships with other household members, neglect of household chores, worse moods, and a decline in professional productivity.</p>
