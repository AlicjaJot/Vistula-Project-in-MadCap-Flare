        <h1>A sense of isolation and loneliness</h1>
        <p>We are social beings. This means that we need constant interaction with others in order to function properly. Remote work deprives or severely limits regular contact with others, which can cause feelings of loneliness or separation from people and the outside world. Persistent isolation can develop into more serious mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety disorders.</p>

        <p>Working remotely, we tend to have various online meetings and conversations, but these cannot fully replace live contact. Even such small interactions with others as giving way on a bus, buying a ticket at a kiosk or letting someone pass you in line for the coffee machine can have a positive impact on your mood. Remote work mode excludes such situations.</p>
