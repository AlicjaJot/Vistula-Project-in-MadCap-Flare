        <h1>Difficulties with communication and teamwork</h1>
        <p>In many positions, daily work life includes effective teamwork or maintaining regular contact with co-workers or clients. In such professions, the home office mode is possible because of remote forms of contact, including telephone, chat rooms, and video messaging. However, there are situations when remote conversations cannot effectively replace live contact.</p>

        <p>Teamwork through technology or remote communication can generate more conflicts, misunderstandings, or other barriers. These include the unreliability of technology (for example, application crashes or Internet outages) and the difficulty of effective collaboration between people in different time zones. Remote co-workers have fewer opportunities to spontaneously share their insights and organize brainstorming sessions.</p>
        <p>Less effective teamwork or the quality of internal communication in home office teams can also be affected by less integration of co-workers. Taking on common challenges may not be as effective if our professional partners are just “icons on the monitor” to us and we know little about them. More close-knit and integrated teams are more effective and willing to help each other. More integrated employees are also much happier and more satisfied in the workplace.</p>
        <div class="accent">Remember, if you are experiencing difficulties with teamwork or communicating effectively with other employees remotely, you can solve these problems. Much depends on you. <a href="../B_Jak utrzymać produktywność i zdrowie/Jak dbać o skuteczną komunikację i pracę zespołową.htm">Find out what steps to take.</a></div>
