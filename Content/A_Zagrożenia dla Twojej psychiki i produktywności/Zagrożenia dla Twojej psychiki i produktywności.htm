        <h1>Threats to your psyche and productivity</h1>
        <h2>Anna 2100 — dystopian vision of a remote worker</h2>
        <p>Anna 2100 is a  3D model created by British company Furniture at Work. “The model” is a result of analysis of scientific research and consultations with multiple medical experts. It was created to show the potentially disastrous effects of unreasonable and irresponsible remote work on the worker's body.</p>

        </p>
        <p>As you can see, Anna 2100 is obese and stooped, the result of lack of exercise, inadequate diet and an unergonomic workstation. Her eyes are red from prolonged staring at screens, and her legs show enlarged veins. Anna 2100's immune system is weakened. The character also suffers from the onset of anxiety and depression.</p>
        <p>Anna 2100 may seem like a highly exaggerated vision of a remote worker, but it's true that at least some of the ailments that afflict her, are developed by very real people who do not take proper care of their health. Remote work can negatively affect not only the physical sphere, but also our psyche.</p>
        <h2>Remote work is not without its drawbacks. You don't have to be a fan of it</h2>
        <p>Despite the advantages of working remotely and many surveys showing that most people prefer this mode, home office can prove to be quite a challenge. Often, problems with remote work can appear only after some time, even several years.</p>
        <p>Remember that:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>You don't have to like working remotely.</li>
            <li>You may have problems with this mode of work.</li>
            <li>You have the right to communicate this to your supervisor.</li>
            <li>You are not an inferior employee.</li>
            <li>You do not have to switch to a stationary job to regain your well-being, productivity and work-life balance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Harness the remote work</h2>
        <p>Learning how to function healthily in a remote work mode is all the more important because the home office has firmly established itself in the global market. Many companies no longer offer stationary cooperation and, in order to keep your position, you sometimes have to accept a forced home office. Often, too, the search for a new job, associated with a salary increase or other desirable benefits, forces one to consider remote work offers in the first place.</p>
        <h3>First of all: self-awareness</h3>
        <p>The solution to the problems that remote work generates begins with properly recognizing them. Often, people who are affected by a decline in their overall well-being for no apparent reason do not realize that aspects of remote work may be to blame. The same goes for trouble with effectively separating work and private life and several other issues.</p>
