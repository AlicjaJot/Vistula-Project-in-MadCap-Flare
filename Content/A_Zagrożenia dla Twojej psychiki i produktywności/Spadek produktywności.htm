        <h1>Decrease in productivity</h1>
        <p>For some people, remote work may not be as effective as a stationary professional mode. Several factors cause a decline in productivity during the home office.</p>
        <h2>Lack of motivation to work and succumbing to distractions</h2>
        <p>Remote work can reduce productivity due to work in a space that is not directly associated with work activities. Even if an employee works in a separate room, he is still close to places that serve and are associated with relaxation or entertainment, for example. The temptation to play a console, watch TV, or walk the dog while working can be an effective distraction from performing duties. Working from home can be lazy. The lack of direct supervision from a boss or the presence of other co-workers doesn't help to reignite motivation either.</p>

        <p>Home life also has an impact on lowering productivity. If an employee combines his duties with childcare or cannot effectively separate himself from the noises of playtime, neighbors' renovations, the dog's barking, etc., he loses the ability to focus.</p>
        <div class="accent">Remember, if you are struggling with yourself, getting tired, and unable to arouse and maintain sufficient motivation for home office work, you can still improve your condition and regain the efficiency of your activities without abandoning home office work. You also don't have to change your company or position if unwanted sounds and stimuli interfere with your effective remote work. Much is up to you.</div>
