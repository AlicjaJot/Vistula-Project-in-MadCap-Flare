        <h1>Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy</h1>
        <h2>Do not be alone with your problems</h2>
        <p>Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy can significantly help remote workers cope with a variety of mental health problems that arise, for example, from feelings of loneliness and isolation, stress, medications or difficulties in separating work and private life. If the lowered mood is already very troublesome, symptoms of depression, panic attacks, insomnia or other serious ailments appear, do not wait until it gets worse, seek immediate professional help from a specialist: a psychologist, psychiatrist or psychotherapist.</p>

        <p>Working with these people can help significantly not only if we are troubled with problems that qualify us to start pharmacotherapy already. Working on introducing new habits, learning to make new friends or increasing self-awareness as to our needs in our professional lives are just some aspects in which the assistance of a psychotherapist can prove invaluable. Remember that you don't have to be alone with your problems.</p>
