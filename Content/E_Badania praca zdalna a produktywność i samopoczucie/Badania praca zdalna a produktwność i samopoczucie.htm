        <h1>Research: remote work vs. Productivity and well-being</h1>
        <p>Since working remotely became more popular in 2020 it also became a field of research. Many companies and research entities tried to analyse how the home office affects the productivity and well-being of employees. In few years many reports and analyses were published, often showing contradicting conclusions.</p>
        <p>Results of some research claim that home office allows for achieving maximum productivity of most office workers. On the other hand alternative papers alarm that the majority of remotely working employees have serious problems with concentration during work hours.</p>
        <p>Due to these extrema’s in many research papers I am in favour of testing the theory on your own skin to see which mode: remote or stationary, suits you better. Do not lean on what the media says. “Home office is more productive – final research” –such and similar headlines can drive one to an even worst state of mind for those that already feel bad on home office. Remote work does not have to be good for you. There is nothing wrong with you even if you are one out of ten people who feel the same.</p>
        <p>Below you can find chosen research results of two __ regarding remote work amongst polish workers. They show that home office can also be connected with various negative aspects. I will not focus here on the advantages of remote work, but I will present most common challenges indicated by the examined employees.</p>
