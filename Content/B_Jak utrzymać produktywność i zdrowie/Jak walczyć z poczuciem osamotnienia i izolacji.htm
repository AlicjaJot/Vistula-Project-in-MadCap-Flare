        <h1>How do you combat feelings of loneliness and isolation?</h1>
        <h2>Talk to your team</h2>
        <p>You have many remote communication tools at your disposal. You can use the phone, chat rooms or video instant messaging. It's natural to talk about work matters, but to combat loneliness or isolation it can help to <b>have chats about personal topics as well</b>. Many remote workers set up separate communication channels on which they occasionally discuss current social issues or chat, perhaps only about the weather. The idea is not to indulge in in-depth discussions during the time set aside for work duties, but to keep in touch with the team and feel part of it. Getting down to private topics helps you get closer. You can initiate the creation of such a channel.</p>

        <h2>Participate in meetings</h2>
        <p>Many teams practice periodic video meetings to discuss current company and departmental issues. This allows employees to know what is going on in their workplace and team, and this fosters a sense of community. If you feel that such meetings are a good idea for you, put it up for discussion.</p>
        <h2>Have an integration “live”</h2>
        <p>Many companies know that an integrated team is a more effective team, so they organize periodic stationary meetings for their employees. Team-building trips may take place once a year, but spending even a few moments with your co-workers in person can help you feel part of a particular group for much longer.</p>
        <h2>Do not work from home</h2>
        <p>Working remotely most often means performing professional duties from your own home, but in the era of considerable popularity of home office mode, there are many places where you can sit down with your laptop and work quietly. These include, for example, some <b>coffee shops or coworking spaces</b>. Going to such places to work allows you to have the simplest of interactions with other people, such as when buying coffee or standing in line for the restroom. Being among people can help combat loneliness and isolation. This being said, try to find an alternative place to work remotely.</p>
        <h2>Make up for it with your personal life</h2>
        <p>Remote work can naturally create a sense of loneliness or isolation. Since such a mode of employment necessarily limits taking daily interactions with others, you need to make up for it with your personal life. Maintain regular contact with family and friends. It may also be a good idea to enroll in a foreign language course, volunteer, use apps that connect people, attend meetings of a local literary enthusiasts' circle, or (after careful consideration of this decision!) adopt a dog from a shelter. All of these solutions boil down to finding ways to <b>be amongst people as often as possible during leisure time</b>, after working hours, which, by its remote mode, cannot provide such interactions.</p>
        <h2>Learn to help yourself</h2>
        <p>Sometimes implementing the ideas mentioned above is not so easy. The team may not like the idea of regular meetings, and not everyone may be bold enough to start talking to co-workers about private matters or have the courage to join a group of new people themselves. An introverted nature or other obstacles can effectively prevent people from fighting feelings of loneliness and isolation on their own.</p>
        <p>If you are plagued by bad moods and trying to deal with your emotions is not working, remember that you can help yourself by working with a professional. Keep in mind that loneliness or isolation often leads to more serious consequences, such as the onset of depression. Therefore, it is not worth to delay <b>asking for help from a psychologist or psychotherapist</b>. Working with a specialist helps you realize what you need to feel better, break down your own barriers to achieve it and learn to work out satisficing solutions. This is an important investment in oneself.
