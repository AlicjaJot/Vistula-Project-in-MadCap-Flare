        <h1>How to effectively separate work and private life while working from home?</h1>
        <h2>Work in a specially dedicated space</h2>
        <p>In order to effectively separate work and private life in a common home space, it is crucial to <b>dedicate a place, specifically a desk, that will be used exclusively for work</b>. Performing work duties from the couch or at the kitchen table or right from the bed is not the best idea. It is advisable that your workplace at home is separated from other part of the apartment that are used for relaxation, entertainment or housework.</p>

        <h2>Time only for work responsibilities</h2>
        <p>Even if we develop a space used exclusively for work, it is still very important not to succumb to any domestic distractions. We're talking about such temptations as, for example, the desire to put the laundry in while doing chores. It's one of the great advantages of the home office mode that small breaks can be used for just this and similar activities, but I don't recommend them if you have a problem with keeping your life and work space clearly separated. Use your work time exclusively for work, and leave private tasks for later. This is of course not to say that you should not take any breaks, but let them be unrelated to your private space. In moments of pause, for example, you can go out for a little walk, and not necessarily wash the bathroom.</p>
        <h2>Strictly defined working hours</h2>
        <p>There is also no effective work-life boundary on a home office without clearly establishing fixed working hours. You don't have to work from 8am to 4pm every day if your company's policies don't demand it - your mode can be a bit more flexible, but nevertheless try to set yourself a strict time frame for performing your duties each day. Such a procedure not only helps to clearly separate professional and private life, but is also very good for work efficiency and productivity. A time frame for a given day, or even for specific duties, does not allow you to dilute your work for too long with too frequent interruptions or a sense of “I have time,” but see the goal as “I have 2 hours left for this task.”</p>
        <div class="accent">Set clear boundaries for your co-workers. If you work until 5 PM, do not answer phones after that time and do not check emails. Take advantage of various options to turn off or mute notifications in business apps that might bother you at a time when you no longer want to think about work.</div>
        <h2>Remote work routine</h2>
        <p>A remote work routine also helps maintain a healthy work-life balance. We can incorporate into this not only fixed, well-defined hours for performing duties, but also meal breaks at similar times or rest in a familiar form, such as taking a walk. It is also good to <b>create for ourselves a ritual that we will associate precisely with the end of work</b> and the beginning of leisure time. This can be the aforementioned walk, going to the gym, moving to the couch, etc. When working from home, it's also a good idea to take care of such things as getting up a little earlier than five minutes before an appointment. Working in pyjamas is also not favourable for effectively separating the professional and private domains. Lying lazily in bed with a laptop is worth saving for a Sunday morning.</p>
        <h2>Working remotely away from home</h2>
        <p>Another way to effectively separate the spheres dedicated to work and private life is to simply not work from home. Today, many remote workers use various <b>coworking spaces</b> or public places with satisfactory Internet connection, such as laptop-friendly cafes. Maybe once in a while it's worth working in just such a place?</p>
        <h2>Effective relaxation</h2>
        <p>If you're following all of the tips listed above, but you're still tempted to fire up your work computer at a time when you're trying to relax, it's a good idea to simply practice effective relaxation. It is something that one also needs to learn. And you can do this. Find an activity that you enjoy and that really draws you in. Maybe it's some old passion abandoned long ago? Maybe you've always wanted to learn to play the guitar? Or maybe, in order not to think about work at home, you just need to go out somewhere, so find something you can do outside.</p>
        <p>Various <b>relaxation techniques</b> can prove to be helpful. Meditation, yoga, mindfulness or breath training, listening to your favourite music - find what works best for you. Meditation, yoga, mindfulness or breath training, listening to your favourite music - find what works best for you. This is important especially if you're constantly under stress or think you are headed toward workaholism, and your loved ones tell you that you are neglecting them by overworking.</p>
        <p>If you feel like you are overwhelmed by successful maintenance of a healthy work-life balance, do not hesitate to ask for help from a professional. A psychologist or psychotherapist are the people who can help you develop the right habits and boundaries.
