        <h1>How to nurture a healthy sleeping routine?</h1>
        <p>To minimize the risk of various sleep disorders or deal with insomnia already present, it is worth taking the following steps:</p>
        <h3>Establish a fixed schedule for work, leisure and sleeping hours.</h3>
        <p>Sticking to a fairly consistent schedule, going to bed and getting up at a fairly consistent time, should help maintain a consistent daily routine and get your body used to responding appropriately (i.e., sleepiness at a particular hour, for example).</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Don't work in the bedroom</h3>
        <p>The bedroom is a space associated exclusively with rest and relaxation. In order to ensure a healthy night's slumber, it is inadvisable to work from the bed or place a desk in this very room. It is even recommended not to have a workspace located close to the bedroom or overlooking the bed.</p>
        <h3>Get out of the house and ensure adequate levels of physical activity</h3>
        <p>If you are plagued by various sleeping problems, make sure you provide your body with a daily dose of exercise. Seldomly leaving the house and lack of any physical activity is a simple recipe for insomnia. Take care to take breaks in the form of regular walks. Find a form of sport that suits your preferences and needs. If you don't know how to start exercising wisely, consult a physical therapist or personal trainer. Consider signing up for regular sports classes in your area or play sports with someone else. You will then find it easier to get motivated</p>
        <p>You can read more about the benevolent effects of physical activity on your health <a href="../F_Sport jako uniwersalna forma pomocy/Sport jako uniwersalna forma pomocy.htm">in this section of the guide</a>.</p>
        <h3>Avoid using electronic devices at least one hour before bedtime</h3>
        <p>Exposure to screens before bedtime can cause problems with sleeping, therefore, at least one hour before bedtime, do not use your laptop, tablet or phone. Instead of an episode of a late-night show or browsing social media, develop the habit of reading a book, meditating, listening to quiet music or gently stretching your muscles. Find ways to chill out.</p>
        <h3>Practice various relaxation techniques</h3>
        <p>Often it's excessive stress and anxiety that cause various sleeping problems, so take advantage of available relaxation techniques. You can do yoga, meditation, mindfulness, muscle stretching, listen to calm music, practice deep breathing, etc. Find the best method for you and learn how to effectively combat stress and anxiety.</p>
        <div class="accent">If you have trouble using relaxation techniques on a regular basis or they are not enough for you, consult a psychiatrist and psychotherapist. Perhaps properly selected medications and working with a specialist will help you. You can read more about psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in <a href="../G_Psychoterapia i farmakoterapia/Psychoterapia i farmakoterapia.htm">this section of the guide</a>.</div>
