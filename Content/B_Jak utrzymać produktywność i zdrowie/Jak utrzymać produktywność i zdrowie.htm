        <h1>How to stay productive and healthy?</h1>
        <p>Every employee may experience various problems with remote work. This is not surprising. Home office is actually a very unnatural mode of work for us. The home space is not associated with the professional sphere.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, <b>you don't have to change your current job right away</b> if you are affected by various problems related to its remote mode. Of course, it may be that the solutions collected in this guide will be insufficient and the only effective way that will remain is a change of employment. Nevertheless, there are many rules and habits, as well as other forms of self-help, that you can implement in order to successfully cope with all the difficulties of remote work.</p>

        <h2>My story</h2>
        <p>The company where I worked gave up renting a big office in the centre of Warsaw and decided to switch the mode of work for most departments to a remote one. I couldn't choose whether I wanted to work from home. One day I just had to clear out my desk and set it up again, but in my own apartment. The only alternative was to change my employer. I didn't want to look for a new job. I liked my current position and at first I also enjoyed the remote mode of it. It wasn't until about a year later that I realized something bad was happening to me. I didn't even notice how I gradually became less and less productive and locked myself in my apartment, stepping out of it less and less often and unable to clearly separate my work from my private life. My well-being and job satisfaction were decreasing. Then I started reading a lot about remote work and how it affects my psyche. I learned about and tested on myself many practical ways to maintain proper home office hygiene. I also underwent psychotherapy and developed the habit of exercising regularly.</p>
        <p>This guide is not only a compendium of knowledge from current research on the impact of remote work on employees. It is also the fruit of my personal experience and my own struggle to develop well-being and job satisfaction. Therefore, <b>I know very well that it is possible to cope with many of the difficulties</b> that remote work causes.</p>
